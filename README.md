# 1. Introduction
About The Project
In the bank, all activities are done manually. As the bank expands its services, it becomes difficult to manage operations manually, leading to the automation of some operations.

Banking Information System is a Windows-based application that mainly deals with managing accounts and related operations. Tasks involved in this project include opening user accounts, recording account holders' transactions, depositing, and withdrawing amounts.

Modules:
Login:
Users enter their User ID and password. Only valid credentials grant access to the member's zone, ensuring security.

Registration Process:
New users can register by providing their details. They receive a User ID and password, which are required to access the details section.

Manage Transaction:
This module handles different types of transactions such as deposits and withdrawals related to customers and the bank.

Administrator:
The administrator monitors the entire site, maintaining and upgrading services for users.


# 3. System Analysis
System analysis is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending improvements. It involves intensive communication between system users and developers.

3.1 Scope of Investigation
The aim of this project is to design, build, and test a "Banking Automation" system. The project will be split into stages and documented thoroughly.

3.2 Problems Faced
[Content to be added based on the problems faced during the project.]

3.3 Proposed System
The proposed system aims to develop a system with improved facilities, proper security, and reduced manual work. It will help users reduce workload and mental conflict.

3.4 Feasibility Study
3.4.1 Technical Feasibility
The system is evaluated from a technical perspective, ensuring that the necessary functions and performance are achieved within constraints.

3.4.2 Economic Feasibility
The system is justified by cost and benefit analysis. Since the system is developed as part of a project, there are no manual costs.

3.4.3 Behavioral Feasibility
The system is designed to ensure user support and satisfaction, making it behaviorally feasible.


# 4. Design Introduction
Design is the first step in the development phase. It involves applying various techniques and principles to define a system in sufficient detail for physical realization.

4.1 Logical Design
The logical design defines the boundaries of the system and includes steps such as reviewing the current physical system, preparing output and input specifications, and specifying the implementation plan.

4.2 Physical Design
The physical design produces the working system by defining design specifications, input and output media, and database design.

4.3 Module Design
[Content to be added based on the module design.]

4.4 Input Design
Input design focuses on controlling the amount of input required, avoiding errors, and ensuring ease of use.

4.5 Output Design
Output design ensures that the information is displayed clearly and meets the requirements of the end user.

4.6 Data Flow Diagram
The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) shows the flow of data within the system, using symbols such as squares for entities, circles for processes, and arrows for data flow.

4.7 Database Design
Database design involves organizing data to ensure integrity and independence. Normalization is used to eliminate data redundancy.

4.8 Relation Database Management System (RDBMS)
RDBMS represents the database as a collection of relations, ensuring data integrity and relationships between tables.

4.9 Table Structure
[Content to be added based on the table structure.]


# 5. Software Environment
5.1 Software and Hardware Requirements
Hardware Specification:
Microprocessor: Pentium-4 class processor, 450 MHz

RAM: 256 MB

Hard Disk: 40 GB

Software Specification:
Operating System: Windows 98/XP/7 or any OS

Database: SQLite

Programming Language: Python 3.8 or above

5.2 Project Architecture and Platform
Front End: Python Tkinter

Back End: Python (Business Logic), SQLite (Database)

5.3 Coding Standards
The system follows Microsoft programming standards, including naming conventions, labels, and comments.


# 6. Testing Introduction
Testing is the process of executing software in a controlled manner to ensure it behaves as specified.

6.1 Test Plans
6.1.1 Unit Testing
Unit testing focuses on individual modules to ensure they function correctly.

6.1.2 Integration Testing
Integration testing ensures that all modules work together as a whole.

6.1.3 Validation Testing or System Testing
System testing ensures that the entire system meets the requirements.

6.1.4 Output Testing or User Acceptance Testing
User acceptance testing ensures that the system satisfies the user's needs.


# 7. Implementation
Implementation involves turning the theoretical design into a working system. It includes user training, system testing, and changeover.

7.1 Implementation Procedures
7.1.1 User Training
User training prepares users for testing and converting the system.

7.1.2 Training on the Application Software
Users are trained on the new application software, including screen flow, error handling, and data entry.

7.1.3 Operational Document
Operational documents provide users with guidance on how to use the system.

7.1.4 System Maintenance
System maintenance ensures that the system remains adaptable to changes in the environment.


# 8. Conclusion
The "Banking Automation" project is a Windows-based application designed with scalability in mind. The system has been tested with valid and invalid data, fulfilling all objectives and replacing the existing system successfully.

8.1 Scope for Future Enhancement
In the future, additional modules can be added to the system. The software can be further developed to include more features, such as database independence using JDBC or conversion to an internet-based system.
